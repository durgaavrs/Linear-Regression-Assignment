## General Information
- To come up with a mindful business plan to accelerate revenue when the pandemic ends and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. Then to create strategy based on the same.

- Meteorological survey's and people style's of shared bikes demand on American Market - BoomBikes dataset


## Conclusions
- Final inference/Business improvement:
1. Temperature has the highest co-efficient. So if it increases by 0.5402, count of bikes rented will increase as well. Business can concentrate on temperature
2. 2019 rentals has improved as compared to 2018. Year is the second influencing factor. 
3. Summer and Winter season has more rentals as compared to other seasons. Can focus more during these
4. Snow and Misty - have a negative co-efficient impacting the number of rentals. Business should think about how to improve during these times


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0
